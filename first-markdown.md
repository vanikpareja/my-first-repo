# Hello Markdown!

It's **sooo*** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

You can write lines of codes like `elif option.upper() == 'T':
which is Python 3 syntax by the way. I learned to code in Python with Dev236x class.

That's it. Enjoy!

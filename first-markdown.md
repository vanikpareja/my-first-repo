# Hello Markdown!

It's **sooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

You can write lines of codes like `elif option.upper() == 'T':`
which is Python 3 syntax by the way. I learned to code in Python with [Dev236x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV236x+2T2018/course/) class.

That's it. Enjoy!
